#  :dog::dog::dog:MatchingApp-Dogs-In-The-Park:dog::dog::dog:
## The Concept 
The concept is a matching app to match dog owners in the park. So, the idea is that dog owners can meet each other in the park through the app. With this idea it's possible to get to know the dog owners in the neighbourhood and to become dog buddies with your neighbours.
## The Feature
In this project I will focus me on one feature of my matching app. The Job story for this feature is:*“when I walk my dog, I want to see my location and the location from other dog owners, so I can make a connection with a dog buddy in my neighbourhood.”*. This is the explanation of the part that I will be working on for my matching app. So, I will focus on the location feature of the matching app. The focus will lay at the parks in the neighbourhood. If you are logged in on the matching app, you will see a map or a dropdown menu where you can go to one of the parks. If you chose a park, you could see which dog buddies are available in this park.
